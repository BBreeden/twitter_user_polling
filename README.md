# Twitter User Polling
Love it or hate it, Twitter is a unique platform. I wanted to study and document tweets from specific users. I wrote this program to poll a user profile every so often and document any new tweets that user composed. These tweets are then saved as JSON objects using MongoDB for future analysis.

This program consists of two parts. user_polling.py can be run as a standalone that will poll 25 tweets back into the user history and record the new tweets. The file tweet_history.py can be run to record older tweets. It is recommended to run tweet_history.py first to build a historic record for the user. Then, run user_polling.py at a regular interval (30 minutes or an hour, for example) to update the records created by the tweet_history.py script.
